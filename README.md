# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows

Here, I have used the Medical-Appointment-No-Shows dataset from Kaggle to perform data cleaning and Preprocessing.

What I did:
1. Import required libraries.
2. Import dataset.
3. Show dataset information.
4. Describe the data.
5. Show any null values.
6. Replacing Age = -1 to mean age of the column.
7. Replacing Age = 0 with mean ages of Male and Female, respectively.
8. Changed the datatype of ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay to DateTime.
9. Split the ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay columns into ScheduledDate, ScheduledTime, AppointmentDate, and AppointmentTime respectively.
10. Dropped ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay columns.
11. Visualized a few charts

    a. Age Distribution by Gender
    
    b. Gender vs Diabetes
    
    c. Gender vs Hipertension

    d. Gender vs Alcoholism

    e. Age vs Alcoholism

    f. Gender vs Scholarship

    g. No show vs Gender
